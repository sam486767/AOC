John John is part 1
John John John is part 2
I copied the data, set pos to 50
set hits to 0
m is the text. 0 is the letter, 1: is the rest. these are set values
it uses the letter to add or subtract the value, the %100 makes it inclusive
if its 0 it adds one to the hits


In the second part the dial moves one unit at a time and adds a hit before moving on.
